Code written to take pattern files, match them to cases, and then work through the transitions from case 8b -> 6 -> 3 -> [ ].  It also contains other random things associated with this work.

As of 28 Feb 2024, this code is a bit messy and could use some clean up / refactoring.  I'd also like to have this as a pipeline where a pattern can go through all the steps in one go.  Perhaps one day when I have more time.
